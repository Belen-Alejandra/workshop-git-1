# Bohemian Rhapsody
## Queen








-----------3--------------
Too late, my time has come 
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's a ching all the time
Goodbye everybody i've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, oh oh (anyway the wind blows)
I don't want to die
Sometimes wish i'd never been born at all
